# flight-project

<p>
Have you ever had your flight delayed and wondered if you were just 
having bad luck or if the carrier has a growing reputation for being late?
</p>


<p>
In this project, we perform time series analysis on flight delay data provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics from 2000-2016, and evaluate the on-time performance for all current airline carriers. Additionally, we identify the factors that influence ticket pricing the most, and how these may be correlated with overall airline performance.
