# flight-project

<p>
Have you ever had your flight delayed and wondered if you were just 
having bad luck or if the carrier has a growing reputation for being late?
</p>


<p>
In this project, we perform time series analysis on flight delay data provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics from 2000-2016, and evaluate the on-time performance for all current airline carriers. Additionally, we identify the factors that influence ticket pricing the most, and how these may be correlated with overall airline performance.
</p>


# Getting started
Data files can be downloaded from the BTS website directly.
An example of how to get all the On-Time Performance tables is provided. 
Although BTS has data for the different Tickets and Coupons, we mostly utilized the Market data, and the
source code for getting those files is also included.
